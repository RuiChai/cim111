Creative Brief:

Sneaker fans are the clients for this website.

This is a website for the people who want to buy some fason sneakers like yeeze, nike & off-white,and so on.
My friends and me are trying to set up a special platfrom or opportunities for our clients and attract them to buy some very popular stuff or something limted edition.
The reason why we want to do this is that it's a good way to active the market and make money from it.
Peple can not only buy the stuff form out website, but also exchange something with others.
The offical NBA websites which sells products are all under lots of pressure. Therefore, people can hardly purchase the stuff they like.
That is the chance to earn some benifits.
There are alreay some websites doing familar things like us. However, we are trying to firgure out some disadvantages of those websites.


Five inspirations:

1:https://www.goat.com GOAT: Buy and Sell Authentic Sneakers
2:https://stockx.com Stock Market of Things | Buy/Sell Authentic Guaranteed‎
3:https://www.ebay.com/ Official Site. | Get the Best Deals‎
4 https://www.footlocker.com/ Sneakers - Athletic Shoes
5 https://2.taobao.com/ A website in China that focus on used shoes



write-up

As for the maketing plan, I am going to do lots of surveys which can show the situation of the maket nowadays.
The key words should be limited edition, fasion brands like Nike, adidas,and so on.
I think I am going to spend at least $1000 a month to stay with the "first news" on the market.
Using google and status to find out which kinds of shoes are popular between young people, and try to buy some shoes from other personal dealers to know more information.
